<about.panel01>World leaders, countries and continents are at odds. Some would speak of a {color=red}new Cold War{/color}, but in eastern Ukraine thousands of civilians face a war that is anything but cold. {color=red}A million people are on the run{/color} and the many fights have claimed {color=red}over 6000 casualties{/color}, though other research speaks of numbers ten times higher.

In Battle of Donetsk you are the commander who plays with the lives of these people. You determine the stakes.
{color=red}Can you win?{/color}</about.panel01>
<about.panel02>Battle for Donetsk is a {color=red}war game with an anti-war message{/color}. It's a confronting "topical game", developed by the independent game studio {color=red}LuGus Studios{/color}. 

With this game LuGus Studios does not wish to take a political stance and does not condone violence and conflict. Instead, we hope the game will create a strong awareness of the conflict in Ukraine and that its sobering character will be food for thought.
